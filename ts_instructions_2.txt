You will get the description of a workspace and you need to construct the corresponding transition systems.

Possible TS types:
2d_pose_region (2D pose [[x,y], phi] with euler angle orientation)
3d_point_region (3D point [x, y, z] without orientation)
2d_point_region (2D point [x, y] without orientation)
turtlebot_load

Transition System 1:
There are 4 states with (x,y) coordinates: 
r1: (0,0)
r2: (0,1)
r3: (0,2)
r4: (1,0)
r5: (1,1)
r6: (1,2)

Initial state: r2

The feasible actions are moves between the 4 states and show what states are connected to each other.
Beware of the direction of each move. The feasible actions are:
Go from r1 to r2
Go from r1 to r4
Go from r2 to r1
Go from r2 to r3
Go from r2 to r5
Go from r3 to r2
Go from r3 to r6
Go from r4 to r1
Go from r4 to r5
Go from r5 to r2
Go from r5 to r4
Go from r5 to r6
Go from r6 to r3
Go from r6 to r5

Transition System 2:
There are 2 available states:
loaded
unloaded

Initial state: unloaded

Feasible actions:
Pick box (when in r2)
Drop box (when in r6)

Skip the repetition of the instruction I gave you. Follow the format given in the example transition system below.
